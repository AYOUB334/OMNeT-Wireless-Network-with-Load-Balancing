# OMNeT-Wireless-Network-with-Load-Balancing
This simulation models a wireless network in OMNeT++/INET with multiple access points (APs) sharing the same SSID (`MyWiFi`) but operating on different channels. It demonstrates **client association based on load balancing** rather than just signal strength.

### âœ… Features
- 3 Access Points (APs) on channels 1, 6, and 11
- Multiple WirelessHosts moving in space (MassMobility)
- Automatic AP selection based on **LoadBalancing** algorithm
- Clients generate ICMP traffic (PingApp)
- Real-time statistics: signal strength, handover count, AP association
- Configurable number of clients (Test1: normal, Test2: overload)

### ðŸ”„ Load Balancing Behavior
Clients select the AP not only based on signal quality but also based on the number of currently associated stations. This is set by:

```ini
**.wirelessHost*.mgmt.accessPointSelection = "LoadBalancing"
